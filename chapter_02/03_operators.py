# Arthmetic Operators

a = 3
b = 2
c = a + b
print(c)

# Assignment Operators

a = 3-1 # Assign 3-1 in a
print (a)
b = 6 
# b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it
b -= 3 # Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it
print(b)

# Comparison Operators

# d = 9<8 # this false because 9 is greater then 8
d = 9!=8  # this true because 9 is not equal to 8
print(d)
